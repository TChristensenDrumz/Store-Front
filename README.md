## Usage

When you get to the page, you will see information about how to create your own store. From here, you can sign up to be a store owner, or sign up to be a customer.

Once you sign in as a store owner, you will be taken to the store editor, where you can add your custom styling, change your store's details (name, tagline, etc), and add products.

The marketplace will display all stores within the site that currently have products on sale. To enter a store, simply click on the store of your choice.

Each store's page will display its own custom styling. There is a description of the store, as well as the top three most popular products. If you click browse collection, you will be taken to a page which displays all products within that store.

When you click on a product, you will be taken to a page that displays the price of the product, an input to choose how many of the product you would like, and an 'add to cart' button.

When you navigate to the cart page, you will see all items within your cart, and the total price for all items. There is a PayPal checkout button which will allow you to securely pay for your items.
